<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hypergeolocation Service Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>PPP</li><li>RTK</li><li>RTK-PPP</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The hypergeolocation service market includes three main types: PPP (Precise Point Positioning), RTK (Real-Time Kinematic), and RTK-PPP (Real-Time Kinematic with Precise Point Positioning). PPP offers centimeter-level accuracy using satellite data, but typically requires post-processing, making it suitable for static applications. RTK provides real-time positioning with similar accuracy, relying on a fixed base station and a mobile receiver, ideal for dynamic applications like surveying. RTK-PPP combines the benefits of both, delivering real-time precision without the need for a local reference station.</p></p>
